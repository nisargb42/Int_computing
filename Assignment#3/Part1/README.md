## Hospital Employee Management System

This is a Java program that simulates a hospital employee management system. The program defines several classes, including `HospitalEmployee`, `Doctor`, `Surgeon`, and `Nurse`, each with their own properties and methods. 


Run the `Hospital` class, which contains the `main` method that initializes the hospital employees and calls their respective `work` methods.

## Classes

The program defines the following classes:

- `HospitalEmployee`: An abstract class that represents a hospital employee with a name and an ID number.

- `Doctor`: A subclass of `HospitalEmployee` that represents a doctor with a specialty.

- `Surgeon`: A subclass of `Doctor` that represents a surgeon with an additional property indicating whether they are currently performing surgery.

- `Nurse`: A subclass of `HospitalEmployee` that represents a nurse with a number of patients.
