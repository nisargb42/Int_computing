# XML Schema Validation using Java DOM Parser

This is a Java program that demonstrates how to validate an XML file against an XML schema using Java DOM Parser.

### The program consists of five files:
- `books.xml`: an example XML file that contains a list of books.
- `books_schema.xsd`: an XML schema that defines the structure and constraints of the books.xml file.
-  `books_dtd.dtd`: This file is a Document Type Definition (DTD) for the book catalog XML file
-  `DomParserSchema.java`: a Java program that loads the books_schema.xsd file, parses the books.xml file, and validates the XML document against the loaded schema.
-  `DomParserDTD.java`: is a Java program that demonstrates how to parse an XML document using the Document Object Model (DOM) and a Document Type Definition (DTD).

## Prerequisites
To run this program, you need the following software installed on your computer:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Eclipse IDE (optional)

## How to Run
- Download the five files and save them in a directory of your choice.
- Compile and Run following files
  -`DomParserSchema.java`
  -`DomParserDTD.java`
